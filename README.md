# Diabetes-Prediction
The objective of the dataset is to diagnose, whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset
the steps as follows for prediction
1. EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. Data Pre-Processing (missing values handling, outlyer detection, outlyer treatment)
3. various visualizations plots like countplot, boxplot, joint plot, heatmap, histogram, scatter plot, pair plot
4. bivariant analysis
5. standardization using Standard scaler process
6. model creation
7. comparison amoung all algorithms
